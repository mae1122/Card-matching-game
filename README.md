Memory Matching Game

This project is a Memory Matching Game developed over the course of four weeks, with a total of 12 hours of work invested. It is a simple card-matching game that offers both single-player and multiplayer modes, aiming to test and improve players' memory skills.

Features

Single Player Mode: Players earn points for each match.
Demerits are applied for each mismatch, adding an extra challenge till it reaches 0.

Multiplayer Mode:
Players take turns trying to find matching cards.
The player with the highest score at the end wins.
A second turn is granted for successful matches.

Unique Joker Cards:
Occasionally, a "Unique Joker Card" may appear. These is a chance of 2 pairs of matching cards due to an issue with card duplication prevention that cannot be matched , but they add a fun twist.

Validated Input:
User input is validated to ensure smooth gameplay.

Cards are shuffled and placed face-down.
If the cards match, they remain revealed.
If they do not match, they are flipped back.
The game ends when all cards have been matched.

Known Issues
There is a small chance of card duplication, which prevents perfect matching I have labeled these as joker cards.
